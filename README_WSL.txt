Installation Guide for Windows Subsystem for Linux

Same prerequisites as Linux and MacOS, but updates for Windows only implemented for WSL. 
  1. Install WSL
  2. Miniconda
  3. Java Installed On Windows (Not a requirement to install on WSL)

After running hyb2_install, you will have to do these manually:
  1. Make sure Java on Windows is installed in C:\Program Files\Java
  2. Copy VARNA/ folder into somewhere in Windows, such as C:\VARNA
  3. Change the contents of VARNA.dir from default (e.g. home/user/hyb2/VARNA/build/jar/VARNAcmd.jar) to "C:\VARNA\build\jar\VARNAcmd.jar"

Run commands are the same.
